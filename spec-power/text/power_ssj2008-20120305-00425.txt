* Each JVM instance was affinitized to four threads on a single socket.        
* Using the local security settings console, "lock pages in memory" was enabled
for the user running the benchmark.                                            
* Turn off hard disk after 1 minute                                            
* Processor power management- Minimum processor state = 0%                     
* Processor power management- Maximum processor state = 100%                   
* Run was started on controller using Remote Desktop.
