* Minimum Processor State: 0%.                                                 
* Maximum Processor State: 100%.                                               
* Turn off hard disk after 1 minute .                                          
* Each JVM instance was affinitized to two logical processors.                 
* Using the local security settings console, "lock pages in memory" was enabled
for the user running the benchmark.                                            
* Enable protection against speculative execution side-channel vulnerabilities 
according to Microsoft guidance:
