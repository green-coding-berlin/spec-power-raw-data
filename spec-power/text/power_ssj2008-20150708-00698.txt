SPEC has determined that this result is not in compliance with the             
SPECpower_ssj2008 run and reporting rules. Specifically, this result has been  
marked as Non-Compliant because more than three years elapsed between the Java 
Runtime Environment General Availability date and the processor General        
Availability, and more than four years between the Operating System General    
Availability and the processor General Availability.
