Used USB-to-Serial converter, Model Sabrent SBT-USC1M (driver version 2.0.2.1),
to connect power analyzer to the controller.                                   
This benchmark result is intended to provide perspective on past power and/or  
performance using the historical hardware and/or software described on this    
result page.                                                                   
The system as described on this result page was formerly generally available.  
At the time of this publication, it may not be shipping, and/or may not be     
supported, and/or may fail to meet other tests of General Availability         
described in the SPEC OSG Policy document, http://www.spec.org/osg/policy.html 
This measured result may not be representative of the result that would be     
measured were this benchmark run with hardware and software available as of the
publication date.
